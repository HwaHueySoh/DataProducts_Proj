Developing Data Products Course Project by Hwa Huey Soh
=========================
Part of the Coursera Data Science specialization track.

Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators
==================

This application uses data from the Swiss dataset.

The information about the data can be obtained [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/swiss.html).

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to acquire a better understanding of **Shiny** for use in building data product applications and **R-Presentation** and **Slidify** for creating data product related presentations.

This particular application takes a look at linear model coefficients between Fertility rates and a series of socio-economic factors that are thought to affect the Fertility rates. 

## How to Use

Select the socio-economic factors you want to examine and the relative graphs and coefficients for the linear modelling of the selected factors will be computed and displayed.
